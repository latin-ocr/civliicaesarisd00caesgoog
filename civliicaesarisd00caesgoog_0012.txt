Tun Memoirs oi Caesar have long been used and will long continue to
be used as an introduction to the knowledge oi Latin. The purity oi
style, the absence oi affectation, the masculine contempt oi mere orna-
ment, t-he military exaetness ei expression, the keen insight into ehar-
aeter and situation, the effective side-strokes which show that the officer
was not lost in the strategist nor the politician in the statesman, all these
things commend Caesar’s writings to more advaneed students‚ but it is to
be ieared that the grammatieul difficulties ei the first books ol the Gallie
War prevent the majority oi beginners from appreciating the merits ot
the author. No one but an experieneed toacher of boys ean tell how
hewildcring orutio‘odlique is at first, but more mature scholars may leurn
to measure tlte trouble approximately by comparing the divergent resolu-
tions of oratio obliqua in commentaries and grammars. The very first
book seems to me miserebly hard ior ayoungboy. and my irientl Professor
Mruenv, who at my request hes estimated the amount of oratio obliqua
in that book, tells me that it constitutes no less than iorty per cent. ol the
whole. The fiith book, on the other hand, is deservedly a laverite with
pupils and teaehers elike, both for the interest oi its themes end the
greater ease oi its style 3 and it hasbeen thought that a separate edition
oi my syntactieal commentary might liud wider uselulness than could be
expected ior the Latin Reader in which that eommentary first appeared. ’
Prepared originally as a drill-boeh in Latin Syntax‚ this edition does not
require the use oi euy special grammar, all the syntaetical rules involved
being stated with as much conciseness as is consistent with elcarness.
